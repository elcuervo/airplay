## Usage

### CLI

```text
air help
air version
```

Protocol verbs (`list`, `play`, `view`, `doctor`) are added by the protocol
changes that implement them.

### Library

#### Configuration

```ruby
Airplay.configure do |config|
  config.log_level         # :debug, :info, :warn, :error or :fatal (Default: :info)
  config.autodiscover      # Allows discovery to run for one-shot commands (Default: true)
  config.advertised_address # Address handed to receivers (Default: nil, chosen per interface)
  config.timeout           # Per-request timeout in seconds (Default: 5.0)
  config.output            # Structured event sink (Default: $stdout)
end
```

Configuration is process-scoped. `Airplay.reset_configuration!` restores the
defaults, which is what the test suite uses between cases.

#### Sessions

```ruby
require "airplay"

device = Airplay::Device.new(name: "Apple TV", host: "192.168.1.12", port: 7000)

Airplay::Session.open(device) do |session|
  response = session.get("/server-info")
  puts response.status
end
```

A session owns one HTTP client, every child task it starts and every socket it
opens. `Session.open` closes all of them before returning, including when the
block raises. Requests are bounded by `config.timeout` and failures raise
`Airplay::Error` subclasses carrying a stable `code`.

The synchronous facade runs the same block in the process reactor:

```ruby
Airplay.open(device) do |session|
  session.get("/server-info")
end
```

#### Status events

Lifecycle and playback status are emitted as structured fields, so a UI can
consume them without parsing text:

```ruby
Airplay::Status.emit("playback.progress", position: 4, duration: 10)
```

When the configured output is a terminal, `Airplay::Status.progress` renders a
progress bar; otherwise it returns `nil` and the structured events are the only
output.
